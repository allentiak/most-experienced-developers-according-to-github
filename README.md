FIXME: my new application.

## About

Code Retreat 2023 repo.


## Usage (verify this!)

FIXME: explanation

Run the project directly, via `:main-opts` (`-m allentiak.<main-ns>`):

    $ clojure -M:run-m
    Hello, World!

Run the project, overriding the name to be greeted:

    $ clojure -M:run-m Via-Main
    Hello, Via-Main!

Run the project's tests (they'll fail until you edit them):

    $ clojure -T:build test

Run the project's CI pipeline and build an uberjar (this will fail until you edit the tests to pass):

    $ clojure -T:build ci

This will produce an updated `pom.xml` file with synchronized dependencies inside the `META-INF`
directory inside `target/classes` and the uberjar in `target`. You can update the version (and SCM tag)
information in generated `pom.xml` by updating `build.clj`.

If you don't want the `pom.xml` file in your project, you can remove it. The `ci` task will
still generate a minimal `pom.xml` as part of the `uber` task, unless you remove `version`
from `build.clj`.

Run that uberjar:

    $ java -jar target/net.clojars.allentiak/<main-ns>-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

## Usage

Tests can be run from the terminal with:

    % clojure -X:test:test/run

(Without the first 'test', 'expectations' can not be found.)

REPL can be run from the terminal with:

    % clojure -M:test:repl/rebel-debug-refactor
