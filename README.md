# Most Experienced Developers according to GitHub

A data transformation pipeline project.


## About

A customer asks our consulting company for a developer with experience in a certain programming language. Write a tool so that the company can check which developer(s) already working at the company have such an experience, based on their GitHub profile information.

### Task 1

Create a database with data about the company members, their repos, and the corresponding programming languages they are proficient in.

### Task 2

Create a view with how many projects each colleague has implemented in a specific programming language.

Example:
- Employee 1
Java 12
Python 2

### Task 3 (optional)

Create a web application to search for a programming language and display the corresponding qualified developer(s), ranked.


## Usage

Run the project directly, via `:main-opts` (`-m allentiak.<main-ns>`):

    $ clojure -M:run-m

Run the project's tests:

    $ clojure -T:build test

Run the project's CI pipeline and build an uberjar:

    $ clojure -T:build ci

This will produce an updated `pom.xml` file with synchronized dependencies inside the `META-INF`
directory inside `target/classes` and the uberjar in `target`. You can update the version (and SCM tag)
information in generated `pom.xml` by updating `build.clj`.

If you don't want the `pom.xml` file in your project, you can remove it. The `ci` task will
still generate a minimal `pom.xml` as part of the `uber` task, unless you remove `version`
from `build.clj`.

Run that uberjar:

    $ java -jar target/net.clojars.allentiak/<main-ns>-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar


## Hacking

Start a REPL from the terminal:

    % clojure -M:repl

Run tests on save:

    % clojure -X:watch-test
